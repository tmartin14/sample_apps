# sample_apps
This repo contains a few quick little sample apps in various languages that can be used as quick tests.  This is specifically geared towards testing Apps running on Cloud Foundry and using New Relic as a monitoring platform, but could be used for any sample needs.

In most cases you'll need to define the following 2 enviornment variables in Cloud Foundry for New Relic integration:
```
  NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME
  NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY
```
